7. With the use of CSS custom properties I made site. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I know how to use Transiton effect and because of this CSS is much easier to know bars are active or not.
```css

  transition: 1s ease;
}
```

### Still Doubt
